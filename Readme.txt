Shaft Design Tool: Detailed Overview
1. Key Concepts:

A shaft is a rotating element that transmits power through the application of torque. It often experiences multiple types of stresses, including:

    Torsional Stress (due to applied torque)
    Bending Stress (due to loads acting perpendicular to the shaft axis)
    Axial Stress (due to forces acting along the shaft axis)

In this tool, the script will compute the required shaft diameter and verify if the design is safe under these loading conditions.
2. Inputs:

The user will provide the following parameters:

    Torque (T): The applied torque on the shaft (in Nm)
    Bending Moment (M): The bending moment acting on the shaft (in Nm)
    Axial Load (F): The axial load applied along the shaft (in N)
    Material Yield Strength (Sy): The yield strength of the shaft material (in MPa)
    Factor of Safety (FoS): Desired safety margin
    Shaft Length (L): The length of the shaft (in mm)

3. Outputs:

The script will output the following:

    Shaft Diameter: The minimum required shaft diameter for the given loading conditions.
    Von Mises Stress: The combined stress acting on the shaft.
    Factor of Safety: The calculated factor of safety based on input stresses.
    Recommended Materials: Based on the calculated stresses, suggest materials that can safely handle the load.

4. Equations Used:

    Torsional Shear Stress (τtτt​):
    τt=T⋅cJ
    τt​=JT⋅c​

    where:
        TT is the applied torque
        cc is the radius of the shaft (half of the diameter dd)
        JJ is the polar moment of inertia for a circular shaft:
        J=π⋅d432
        J=32π⋅d4​

    Bending Stress (σbσb​):
    σb=M⋅cI
    σb​=IM⋅c​

    where:
        MM is the bending moment
        II is the second moment of area for a circular shaft:
        I=π⋅d464
        I=64π⋅d4​

    Axial Stress (σaσa​):
    σa=FA
    σa​=AF​

    where:
        FF is the axial load
        AA is the cross-sectional area of the shaft:
        A=π⋅d24
        A=4π⋅d2​

    Von Mises Stress (σvmσvm​):
    The von Mises stress is used to combine the above stresses for design purposes:
    σvm=σa2+σb2+3⋅τt2
    σvm​=σa2​+σb2​+3⋅τt2​

    ​

    Factor of Safety (FoS):
    FoS=Syσvm
    FoS=σvm​Sy​

    where SySy is the yield strength of the material.

5. Workflow:

    The user inputs the required loading and material properties.
    The script calculates the torsional, bending, and axial stresses acting on the shaft.
    It computes the von Mises stress to combine these stresses into a single value.
    The minimum shaft diameter is determined iteratively to satisfy the required factor of safety.
    Based on the stresses and factor of safety, the script suggests appropriate materials for the shaft.

6. Libraries:

    numpy: For performing numerical calculations (stresses, diameters, etc.).
    matplotlib: For plotting the stress distribution along the shaft or displaying graphical results.
